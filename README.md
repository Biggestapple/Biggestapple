### Hi Everyone !!!  😀😀😀  ✨✨✨  
------
I'm **an independent hardware (mostly based on systemVerilog and Verilog) and*  
*software (ranging from C to python etc :) ) developer**，even though my current research direction
is focused on **condensed matter physics** :) which means I may have a quite long time interval on my repository update 😬😬😬  
------
⚡ My research interests:  
1.  Computer Architecture Design  
	1. 8bit/32bit CPU implementation ranging from *8051, Z80 to RSIC-V etc*
	2. Modern graphic processing pipeline including *ISP, GHP and lightGPU*
	3. Retro peripheral replica like *nes, snes'PPU*
2.	Embedded System Design
	1. ARM instruction set programming mainly on *cortex-m0 and arm9*
	2. DSP programming based on *tms320c6424 device*
	3. Real-time operating system design
